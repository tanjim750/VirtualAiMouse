Virtual mouse project
Using Python


This project involves creating a virtual mouse that allows users to control their computer using hand gestures. By utilizing a webcam and computer vision techniques, hand movements are detected and interpreted to simulate standard mouse actions such as moving the cursor, clicking (left, right, and middle), and scrolling. The implementation leverages Python libraries such as OpenCV for gesture recognition and pyautogui or pynput for mouse control.

Key Features:
	-  Mouse Movement
	-  Clicking (left, right)
	-  Scrolling (Vertical, Horizontal)
	-  Zoom
	-  Volume (Up and Down)
